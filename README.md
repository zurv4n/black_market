# black_market
An alteration of VORP_STORES to amke a floating black market

This script is a modified derivative of VOPR_STORES written by the authors of VORP_CORE (https://github.com/VORPCORE). 

The purpose of the script is to give a black market within RedM that chooses random location to spawn the market. It operates on server restart and all locations can be customized. It is currently set to work by spawning two black markets among a choice of eight but all this can be edited. You can change these numbers by tweaking the script. 

You will need to choose your locations and enter them into the config file. This script is edited the same as VORP_STORES.

Thank you to the authors of VORP_CORE for their efforts which mine were baseed off of.
